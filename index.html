	<p><strong>This application is mainly used in Alibaba.com F2E Team, but it should work for anyone else.</strong></p>

	<h1>YComboGUI</h1>

	<p><em>The GUI Front-End for YCombo.</em></p>

	<h2>Requirement</h2>

	<p>This application runs under Microsoft Window, and also depends on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=19">Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0</a> and <a href="http://www.java.com/getjava/">Java Runtime Environment</a>.</p>

	<p>If you decide to compile this application by yourself, in addition to .NET Framework 2.0, you also need Microsoft Resource Compiler(contained in Windows SDK) and ILMerge, both could be downloaded at <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/">download.microsoft.com</a>.</p>

	<h2>Installation</h2>

	<p>Download the latest <a href="http://nqdeng.github.com/YComboGUI/ycombogui-latest.zip">zip package</a>, extract all contents to a proper folder(ex. C:\Program Files\YComboGUI), then run the execution file and enjoy.</p>

	<h2>Usage</h2>

	<p>You could add inputs by Drag&amp;Drop, or by the menu bar. If you decide to integrate context menu into Windows Explorer, you could also add inputs by right clicking on the target and select the "YCombo" menu item.</p>

	<p>After all inputs being added, you could adjust the combo options and click the "YCombo!!" button to start combination. Option details could be found in YCombo document.</p>
