This application runs under Microsoft Window, and also depends on [Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=19) and [Java Runtime Environment](http://www.java.com/getjava/).

If you decide to compile this application by yourself, in addition to .NET Framework 2.0, you also need Microsoft Resource Compiler(contained in Windows SDK) and ILMerge, both could be downloaded at [download.microsoft.com](http://download.microsoft.com/).

Installation
------------

Download the latest [zip package](http://nqdeng.github.com/YComboGUI/ycombogui-latest.zip), extract all contents to a proper folder(ex. C:\Program Files\YComboGUI\), then run the execution file and enjoy.

Usage
-----

You could add inputs by Drag&Drop, or by the menu bar. If you decide to integrate context menu into Windows Explorer, you could also add inputs by right clicking on the target and select the "YCombo" menu item.

After all inputs being added, you could adjust the combo options and click the "YCombo!!" button to start combination. Option details could be found in YCombo document.
